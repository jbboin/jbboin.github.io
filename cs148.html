<p>This image was rendered with OpenGL for the scanline assignment of this class.</p>
<p>I modeled all the meshes as low poly meshes on <a href="http://www.blender.org"><b>Blender</b></a>, and they were then loop-subdivided if needed to look smoother.</p>
<p>The textures (egg, marble, coffee, orange skin and orange pulp, background) were all taken from the Internet (most of them come from <a href="http://www.cgtextures.com/"><b>CGTextures</b></a>, which has a big database of convenient textures). The pattern from the cereal box is adapted from a T-shirt found online.</p>
<p>The egg, orange skins, and orange pulp have a normal map, generated from the texture using <a href="http://www.crazybump.com/"><b>CrazyBump</b></a>. The orange skins also have a displacement map so that they don't look too artificial (a sphere with a normal map looked really too artificial), and the same for the donuts. I made the displacement maps from a computer generated cloud pattern on Blender. I could choose the size of the patterns so that the objects would not be too flat or too bumpy.</p>
<p>The icings of the donuts were a bit tricky : I used a fluid generator with high viscosity to generate a fluid torus falling on a solid torus, and I took one of the images that looked adequate. I then smoothed the surface to get a nice icing.</p>
<p>I blurred the background to simulate very grossly a depth of field. The result is not that convincing but it's still much better than a uniform background.</p>
<p>On the whole, this image has some interesting textures and geometry but it still seems very unreal, mainly because of the absence of shadows on the horizontal plane. With more time, I could have designed a way to make them appear by modifying the shader.</p>
